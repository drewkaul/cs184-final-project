<h1>Transferring Camera Motion from Video to 3D Graphics</h1>
<h2>CS184 Spring 2019 Final</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The virtual camera in video games and CG movie scenes is critical to telling stories. A camera swooping in between highrises tells a different story from a camera
    strapped to the forehead of an adventurer sprinting away from a threat. Normally, cameras are programmed to move along and look down a predefined spline. While this
    works well for most cases, it fails to capture the "natural" movements that a camera undergoes. For example a camera strapped to a car driving down a bumpy road vibrates
    and rotates randomly. A camera attached to a skateboard undergoes similar random movements that are different from that of a camera attached to a car or a runner. Defining
    these fine movements programatically would be difficult and may not reflect the physical world. So, our project aims to use Monocular Visual Odometry to extract the translation and
    rotation that a real camera experiences just by looking at the video that it takes. We then construct a spline out of the position data and have a virtual camera follow this spline
    while it's playing back the rotations recorded from the real camera. This creates a slightly more convincing virtual camera movement that more closely reflects the physical world.
</p>

<h2>Visual Odometry</h2>

<p>Visual odometry is a general term for recovering position and rotation data of a camera simply by looking at a set of images that it took when moving. Although smartphones 
  have accelerometers, numerical integration to compute position is very inaccurate and prone to "drift". Gyroscope data for rotations is much more reliable but requires filtering
  to be usable. Instead we rely on principles of stereo vision to compute the relative pose between two "cameras". In otherwords we can compute the relative translation and rotation
  that the camera undergoes to go from some frame $F_i$ to $F_{i+1}$.
</p>

<p>Assume the camera undergoes rotation $R$ and translation $T$ between the two frames, then a 3D point $P_i$ is related to $P_{i+1}$ by the following relation.</p>
<p class="math">$P_{i+1} = R(P_i - T)$</p>
<p>Epipolar geometry tells us that $P_{i+1}$, $T$, and $P_i - T$ are coplanar. The Wikpedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipolar_geometry">Epipolar geometry</a> as well as the
listed references have some great visualizations to help convince you of this fact.</p>
<p>We know that any vector that lies along a plane is orthogonal to the plane's normal vector, so we can write this constraint.</p>
<p class="math">$(P_i - T)^T(T \times P_i) = 0$</p>
<p class="math">$(R^TP_{i+1})^T(T \times P_i) = 0$</p>
<p>Recall that a cross product $a \times b$ can be re-written as a matrix-vector multiplication with the rank 2 skew-matrix of $a$ denoated as $[a]_{\times} b$</p>
<p class="math">$(R^TP_{i+1})^T([T]_{\times}P_i) = 0$</p>
<p class="math">$P_{i+1}^TR[T]_{\times}P_{i}$ = 0</p>
<p class="math">$E = R[T]_{\times}$</p>

<p>We have reduced our problem of recovering the relative pose between two "cameras" to estimating the essential matrix $E$ and decomposing it to recover $R$ and $[T]_x$. In order to do this in practice
  we used OpenCV's implementation of <a href="http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/imag/courses/Sturm/nister04.pdf">Nister's 5-Point algorithm</a> which can efficiently estimate the Essential Matrix by assuming knowledge of the camera calibration parameters. We ran camera calibration on
  the iPhone 6S to recover its focal length and principle point. The distortion parameters were negligible. If you're curious about how this relates to the more commonly known Fundamental Matrix, $F = K^{-T}EK^{-1}$.
  So, another way to compute $E$ is to use the 8-Point algorithm to estimate $F$ and then move it into "normalized camera coordinates" by factoring out the camera matrix $K$.
</p>

<p>Recovering $R$ and $[T]_x$ from $E$ can be done using SVD, but there are four possible solutions to the rotations and translations. OpenCV's <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html#void%20decomposeEssentialMat(InputArray%20E,%20OutputArray%20R1,%20OutputArray%20R2,%20OutputArray%20t)">decomposeEssentialMat</a>
tests all possible solutions to returns the one that makes the most geometric sense.</p>

<p>After $R$ and $T$ are recovered for frames $F$ and $F_{i+1}$ for all $i$, we can generate the camera's path by hitting a point at the origin with $R_i$ and $T_i$ to get the subsequent point.</p>

<h2>THREE.js GUI and Environment</h2>

<p>In order to present our results we used a popular WebGL wrapper called THREE.js which makes it easy to define and animate 3D scenes that can run on the web.
    The details about how the UI works aren't very interesting but it involved a lot of software engineering fundamentals like modularization of code and defining
    data structures. We spent some time refactoring the code base to make it easy to visualize arbitrary translations and rotations that are passed in so that we
    could debug and iterate quickly.
